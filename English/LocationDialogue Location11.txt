It almost killed him.
Everything is fine...
Winter... it's very cold.
I don't know

But I agree!

But it's true
This is a dangerous place...

// After a while 1
No rain!
They follow you.
Which ended

Run, run!
i cry
Good job!
Wow, great!

// After a while 2
I see you sitting in the cable car
It is long.
Among the people living...
How do I get there?
Some people live there
In these areas

Help me find...
shoes...
Make me think...
My mind is empty...
What happened here?
// Cry 1
Forget everything..
you won the race
Open this image...
but this is...
everything is dark
I'm crazy
Yes, everyone makes mistakes…
what else to do
When does the result deteriorate?
I'm glad to be back, but...
// Cry 2
They say time heals all wounds.
But when?
I don't believe in anything anymore.
But time will heal.
Or take me there
Please leave this world...
Happy ending
how often
I'm dying now.
At some point
// Cry 3
you love me...
I love you too
But my love is different
Your love will last forever
A little embarrassing...

Every time...
Jealousy...
Anger...
They are crazy...
// Cry 4
Please tell...
Are you really afraid?
like...
You are not my only friend...
But what else?

i was wrong...
It's scary.
// Cry 5
Crazy...
I don't remember...
but...
Endless balls...
I was not disappointed with the result.
I stopped...
I'm still here
but why?
I don't remember...
Is this a parking lot?
I have no idea...

// Mita get picture
He...

I just remember
Thank you very much...
Just my face
no face...
It's all yours.
Then they hugged
It's hard...
Continue...
you are smart
I can't control my child.
If you want to see your room…

Does it end there?

Just because you're big doesn't mean you're strong!
